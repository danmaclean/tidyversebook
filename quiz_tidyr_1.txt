Quiz 1.

1. 

install.packages(nycflights)
library(nycflights)


2. 

flights %>%
+ group_by(tailnum) %>%
+ summarize(av_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
+ arrange(av_delay)

(NAs appear lower in table, not all answers are messed up, not all tailnums have NAs)



3. 


flights %>% 
group_by(hour) %>% 
summarize(av_delay = mean(arr_delay ))

(appears not to work - all hours have some NA)

flights %>% 
group_by(hour) %>% 
summarize(av_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE ))

4. 

flights %>%
+ group_by(dest) %>%
+ summarize(total_delay = sum(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

5. 

flights %>% 
select(tailnum, flight, year, month, day, dep_time, origin, dest, air_time, distance)  %>% 
mutate(av_speed = distance / air_time ) %>% 
arrange(desc(av_speed))


6.

> flights %>% 
+ group_by(dest) %>% 
+ summarize( n_carriers = n_distinct(carrier) ) %>%
+ filter(n_carriers >= 2 )
